Welcome to the collection of vRealize Automation ABX Python Scripts that will 
connect and help you manage your VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) SDDC & NSX-T
environment!

These scripts can be uploaded into your vRealize Automation Cloud
or vRealize Automation 8.x environment.

If you are not familiar with ABX, it stands for Action Based Extensibility. 
This is a cool feature in vRealize Automation that is basically multi-cloud
FaaS which support python and node.js across clouds, and Powershell
for on-prem vCenter. 

So basically this site contains a compilation of ABX scripts that can help
with VMC on AWS onboarding and ongoing maintanence. 

This site is a work in progress! And we welcome input.
