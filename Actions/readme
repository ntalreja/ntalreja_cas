Welcome to the collection of vRealize Automation ABX Python Scripts that will 
connect and help you manage your VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC) SDDC & NSX-T
environment!

These scripts can be uploaded into your vRealize Automation Cloud
or vRealize Automation 8.x environment.

If you are not familiar with ABX, it stands for Action Based Extensibility. 
This is a cool feature in vRealize Automation that is basically multi-cloud
FaaS which support python and node.js across clouds, and Powershell
for on-prem vCenter. 

So basically this site contains a compilation of ABX scripts that can help
with VMC on AWS onboarding and ongoing maintanence. These scripts are all 
written in python.

Also there is a blog in progress that will walk you through in more detail how
to use these scripts within vRealize Automation.

This site is a work in progress! And we welcome input.

Instructions:

Download .abx and .py, zip the files up and import into vRealize Automation 
Cloud. Enter your Refresh Token into the script. Also you will want to have your 
SDDC ID and ORG ID available. Some scripts require both SDDC and ORG IDs, and
some just one or the other.

Know Issues:

When using AWS Lambda as the FaaS provider you may encounter a warning message
in the logs referring to urllib3 and charset version mismatch. This does 
not appear to affect the script action but can be annoying when doing a GET
action and you just want to see the log output. One method that seems to work to
get around this is using the On-Prem ABX appliance instead of AWS Lambda.
